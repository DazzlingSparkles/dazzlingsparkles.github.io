        <h1> PENTEST </h1>
	<h2> Vulnerable to reverse tabnabbing</h2>
	<h3> When a user clicks on the Vulnerable Target link/button then the Malicious Site (with malicious script) is opened in a new tab (as expected) but the target site in the original tab is replaced by the phishing site. For testing purposes, this is the site, but it could have fake login page saying you've been logged out and asking to input your credentials again which would then be sent to the attacker.</h3> 
	<h3>To summarize, it's the capacity to act on parent page's content or location from a newly opened page via the back link exposed by the opener JavaScript object instance.<h3>
